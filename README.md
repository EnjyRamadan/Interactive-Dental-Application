# ðŸ¦· Integrating Interactive 3D Applications for Enhanced Learning in Crown Preparations  

### **A Comparative Experimental Study between Hand Gestures, TUIO, and AR**  

##  Overview  

This project explores **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** techniques to enhance learning in **dental crown preparation** using **Interactive 3D Applications**. It conducts a **comparative experimental study** evaluating the effectiveness of:  

-  **Hand Gesture-Based Interaction**  
-  **Tangible User Interfaces (TUIO)**  
-  **Augmented Reality (AR)**  

The goal is to determine the most effective interaction method for **improving student engagement, skill acquisition, and learning efficiency** in **dental education**.
